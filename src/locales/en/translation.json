  "betweentwocities": "Fill a square; same #s can’t be orthogonally adjacent. Gain a bonus when you complete a row/column. Score stars equal to the lowest of the other 2 realms this round. This # cannot be higher than filled squares here.",
  "charterstone": "Mark either a bonus (note the other rolled die on the crate) or all crates matching the die.",
  "euphoria": "Either mark 1 # OR (if a pair is rolled) you may mark both #s. Then bonus is based on the sum of that area.",
  "mylittlescythe": "Mark a hex and gain a pumpkin or heart. Gain a coin when you complete a matching pair (i.e. 1 & 1). Gain 2 stars each time you earn the 6th resource of each type (pumpkins, hearts, coins).",

  "thesociety": "Fill cards in any order (1 number per card; multiple cards may have the same number). Each card number must be lower than the number directly above. Gain a bonus when completing a row. Score 1 star per set of completed cards (a set is a mini card pyramid—1 card on top and 2 cards directly below it). Most cards appear in multiple sets. If you fill all cards, gain a 6th star.",
