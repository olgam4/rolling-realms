  "betweentwocities": "Fill a square; same #s can’t be orthogonally adjacent. Gain a bonus when you complete a row/column. Score stars equal to the lowest of the other 2 realms this round. This # cannot be higher than filled squares here.",
  "charterstone": "Mark either a bonus (note the other rolled die on the crate) or all crates matching the die.",
  "euphoria": "Either mark 1 # OR (if a pair is rolled) you may mark both #s. Then bonus is based on the sum of that area.",
